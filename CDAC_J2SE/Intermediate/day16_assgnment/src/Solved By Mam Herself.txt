Day 16
1. Revise class work

2. Refer to Day13 , book library assignment.
At the time of launching the app , load book details from a bin file using de-serialization 
Before terminating save book details
(Collection + I/O)
//solved in the lab itself refer-->>> day16_lab
2.1 Add i/f : IOUtils
2 methods
1. static void storeData(map, fileName) throws ....
{
 //Java App --->OOS(ser) --->FOS( Bin File)
//method : writeObject(map)
}

2. de-serial
static  Map<...> restoreData(fileName) 
{
   //Java App <---- OIS <----FIS(bin file)  --in case of FNFExc(IOException) ----create new EMPTY map n ret
   readObject : downcasting (Object ----> Map)
}


3. Create multi threaded java application --- having 3 threads
main , even , odd.

Create EvenPrinterTask  & OddPrinterTask
Accept from user (in main thread)-- start & end values.
Pass these values from main to child threads
Even no printer thread  should print even nos within range, with small delay (sleep)
Odd no printer thread should print odd nos within range , with small delay (sleep)
Ensure no orphans.

Solve above using  implements Runnable scenario.
