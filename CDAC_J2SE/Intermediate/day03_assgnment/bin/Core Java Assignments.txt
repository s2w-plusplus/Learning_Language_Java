Day 3

1. Revise entire class work.

1.1 Import eclipse project day3.1 in your workspace

Solve this
Double box width for all boxes having volume > 100.(USE for-each & solve this : for understnding for-each clearly)


1.5 Solve this without IDE pls.
Copy earlier created Point2D class  n place it under the package "com.geometry"
Copy earlier created TestPoint class n place it under "tester" package.
Solve compiler errors n run it without IDE , w/o setting classpath
Then set CLASSPATH , so that you can run it from anywhere



2. Solve
Create new eclipse project "day3_assgnment"
Copy Point2D class n TestPoints class along with the packages in IDE.

2.1 Create a new tester in package "com.tester" : TestPointArray
 Prompt user , how many points to plot?
Create suitable data structure  , to store Point2D type of references.

2.2 Add a menu , Run the application till user chooses option 10 (exit)

1 Plot a new point
I/P --index , x & y
eg : If user supplies 5 50 100
Create a Point2D with x, y of (50,100) & its reference should be stored at the 5th index position in array.

2 Display all points plotted so far. (Use for-each)

3. Test equality of 2 points
I/P : index1 , index 2
eg If user enters 1 7 , you have to check if point at 1st n 7th index is same.
If same , print "SAME" , otherwise print "DIFFERENT"

4. Calculate distance
I/P strt , end point indexes.
eg : If user enters 2 6
Find out the distance between 2nd & 6th point. (array indexes start from 0)

10. Exit

Note : Boundary condition checking & null checking is expected.
(Meaning : if user supplies invalid index , then give error message : invalid index --out of range
If no point is plotted at user specified index , then give error message : invalid index -- no point plotted here.)
